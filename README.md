# jakesteeves.com

This is the portfolio website for Jake Steeves! I am passionate about coding
and engineering in all forms. I made this site not only to showcase my skills,
but also to practice them.

I created this website using many of the practices that I have learned while
working professionally and personally on projects. This static site is coded
in React, starting with the basic create React app script and integrating
advanced project standards that I developed while working at HSA DEV. This
website is configured for continuous quality using eslint, prettier, and
Travis CI through github. For optimal performance, this site utilizes
advanced React libraries such as styled components, react breakpoints,
and react fontawesome.

This website is hosted on Amazon Web Services, using S3 to store the project
build files and CloudFront to distribute content over a secure network,
configured for HTTPS with Amazon Certificate Manager. The website is routed
to jakesteeves.com through Route53.
